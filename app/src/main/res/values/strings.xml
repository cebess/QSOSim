    <string name="info_data">This program was initially created on Android in 2016 by AD5EN - Charlie Bess and called QSOSender3.\nThe purpose of the program is to aid hams learning Morse code by copying sounds similar to those heard on the air. The faster the Transmit speed selected, the longer the QSO generated. You can also paste text into the QSO text field. Use the M+ and M- keys to save and recall the QSO text field.\nIf the code generated sounds scratchy, adjust the tone up or down.</string>
    <string name="farns">Farnsworth timing is only helpful until about 18 WPM.\nAt speeds higher than that listening to individual letters will slow down your CW comprehension.</string>
